# Bank Data
Your script processes bank transaction data to identify customers eligible to buy products based on specific criteria: a current account balance above 30,000, a transaction amount above 5,000, and an age between 18 and 40 years. The script reads the data, handles missing values by filling numerical columns with the mean and categorical columns with the mode, and filters out invalid birthdates. It then filters customers who meet the criteria and calculates their ages correctly. Finally, it outputs the filtered data and the total number of eligible customers.
