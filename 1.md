# Calculator
The code defines a basic calculator in Python. It prompts the user to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /). It then performs the chosen operation and displays the result. The program continues to execute operations until the user decides to exit.

## About Project
1: Functionality: The project is a basic calculator program implemented in Python.

2: User Interaction: Users are prompted to input two numbers and select an arithmetic operation from a predefined set (+, -, *, /).

3: Operations: The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

4: Input Validation: The program includes input validation to ensure that users enter numeric values for numbers and select a valid operation.

5: Arithmetic Operations: Upon receiving user input, the program performs the selected arithmetic operation on the input numbers.

6: Output: The result of the operation is displayed to the user.

7: Looping: The program is designed to run in a loop, allowing users to perform multiple calculations in a single session.

8: Continuation: After displaying the result, the program prompts the user if they want to perform another operation.

9: User Control: Users can choose to continue with another operation or exit the program by entering 'no'.

10: Error Handling: The program handles division by zero scenarios and ensures a smooth user experience throughout the calculation process

## Result
It give result like this:
```
WE CAN DO FOLLOWING OPERATION: + - * / 
Enter num1: 1
Enter num2: 2
Enter operation + - * / +
3
Do you want to perform another operation? (yes/no): no
```
