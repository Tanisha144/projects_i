# Fraud_Detection
The script evaluates the accuracy of a fraud detection model using a credit card dataset. It loads the dataset, separates the features (X) and true labels (y_true), and compares them against a set of predicted labels (y_pred), which are all set to zero in this example. The accuracy score is calculated to measure the match between predicted and true labels, and this score is printed at the end of the script.

## About project
1: Project Goal: Evaluate the performance of a fraud detection model using a credit card transactions dataset.

2: Dataset: Utilize a credit card dataset (creditcard.csv) containing transaction features and labels indicating fraud or non-fraud.

3: Data Loading: Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.

4: Feature Extraction: Separate the dataset into features (X) and labels (y_true), assuming the labels are in the last column.

5: Model Prediction: Use a placeholder for model predictions (y_pred), initially set to all zeros for demonstration.

6: Performance Metric: Calculate the accuracy score to evaluate how often the predicted labels match the true labels.

7: Accuracy Calculation: Use the accuracy_score function from sklearn.metrics to compute the accuracy of the model.

8: Output: Print the accuracy score to assess the model's performance in detecting fraud.

9: Next Steps: Replace the placeholder predictions with actual predictions from a trained model for a realistic evaluation.

10: Final Objective: Improve the model and its evaluation to accurately identify fraudulent transactions, reducing financial losses due to fraud.
